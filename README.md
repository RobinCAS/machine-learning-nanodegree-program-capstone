# machine-learning-nanodegree-program-capstone

## Abstract
This project was undertaken as part of the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program
offered by Udacity (https://www.udacity.com).  It is a supervised learning problem
that uses a data set acquired via the University of California at Irvine (see 
Acknowledgements).  The data set is a collection of simulated data that was created
to look like data acquired from a MAGIC gamma telescope.  The problem is to use
the provided data set to create a classifier that can differentiate between background
noise and true signal.  There are over 11,000 data points in the set, so training
is highly plausible.

## Requirements
In order to run the project, Python 2.7 must be installed, along with the following
packages (note that the versions are those used on my machine - it is possible that
the code will run with earlier versions of the packages, and almost certain that it
will run with later versions):
* numpy (version 1.10.4)
* pandas (version 0.18.0)
* sklearn (version 0.17.1)
* Tkinter (version $Revision: 81008 $)
* matplotlib (version 1.3.1)

## Acknowledgements
As mentioned above, the data set used in this project was generously uploaded by
the University of California at Irvine through their Machine Learning Repository.
